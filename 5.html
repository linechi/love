      <p>I know it's been pretty tough lately, but I still love you the same way. Perhaps even more, since I know your
        weaknesses and such. It makes me feel like we might understand each other more, from both sides. You had your
        days, I did too. I sometimes unintentually hurt you (even though I didn't want to), but that makes me understand
        more when you do it. I love you so much and I wanted to work hard on this project, because I am really in love
        with you. I hope I can win your heart regards it is more precious than all the wealth in the world, you truly
        deserve the best and I am so grateful to be by your side and support you. It's been only 4 months but it feels
        like forever with you. I'm so happy that you're happy, safe and breathing. I can't stop smiling when I
        think of you. When I get a notification, I always hope it's you... you're so kind and I love the way you think
        and take care of me. Am I naive to think you're the love of my life? I can't
        wait to build a deeper connection with you. I don't care about what anyone says or what people think.
        I just want to be with you, you make me happy, you make me feel like an actual human being.I love all your
        random facts,
        you're like a wikipedia ngl. You have funny jokes too, overall your humour is great, I find it so attractive, I
        can sit there and listen to you jam
        about things for days.You're majestic, I just want to love you effortlessly and I also want to work harder so I
        can spoil you.I
        think i'm going to cry, i mean out of happiness of course... I'm just so jolly. We can work this out. I love you
        so much, darling </p>
