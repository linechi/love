        <h3>𝔄𝔯𝔤𝔲𝔪𝔢𝔫𝔱𝔰</h3>
        <p>I know we argue a lot, and I honestly feel a little sad when we argue, I know sometimes it's my fault and
          sometimes yours, but I feel like when we argue, the World is falling apart. I refuse to communicate when you
          hurt me, but only because I can't say anything back and the situation is too stressful for me. I don't want to
          give you a silent treatment, but for some reason, I am unable to talk to you when I'm at the edge of crying. I
          want to argue less, it's not easy when something happens every day, but I think we can work on it. But
          what I really don't appreciate is when you raise your voice at me, it makes me feel like I'm at home with my
          mom, constant screaming, yelling, and hitting. I know you don't hit me or at least try to not do that, but it
          doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. Please don't hit me. It just makes me more afraid of you. You wouldn't want
          that, right..? Or do you want to make it obvious, that you have power over me? I'm not making assumptions, but
          this is what I think. Hopefully, it will get better, I love you and I believe we can work on it together,
          because that's where true love begins, right? Honestly, sometimes we even argue about stupid things, it's
          kinda
          funny. Fun fact: I'm currently writing all of this while I'm sad, but just because I am upset/sad doesn't mean
          I love you less. I still love you the same amount.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>𝔅𝔓𝔇 𝔞𝔫𝔡 𝔪𝔬𝔯𝔢</h3>
      <p>I know it's hard for you to deal with me, trust me it's also hard for me. I'm sorry for the splits and
        sometimes disgusting things I say. I don't mean it, but sometimes my brain fucks with me = snap. Most
        people would assume I'm insane and would immediately put me in a mental hospital, including my mom, but you're
        always there for me. I'm really thankful for you understand me you know? I don't like to blame
        my mental illness for it, but after all, it's a personality disorder, so obviously it has an impact on my
        behavior, right? You can disagree with me, but I've lived like this my entire life, so I think I know what's
        wrong. I'm trying to maintain calmness, but god, being off pills for weeks really sucks and I think it fucks
        with
        my brain so much idk what's up anymore. It can be very challenging. Depression also hits a lot and most of the
        time I don't like to do anything, that's why when I find something addicting, I try to finish it fast (like
        this project). I usually don't have the energy to do anything or code, but when I find the motivation
        it feels like a rush in my brain and I don't want to stop coding. So I try to use the maximum of it. I hope you
        understand, that it also affects cleaning (I am NOT putting the whole blame on it, it's my own responsibility),
        just
        saying it doesn't help either. I will try my best, I know it doesn't seem like it, but I do put a lot of effort
        into it, but It's just... I don't know, I can't do more (that's why I feel so useless.)</p>

      <h3>𝔐𝔬𝔯𝔢 𝔢𝔭𝔩𝔞𝔫𝔞𝔱𝔦𝔬𝔫</h3>
      <p>I promise I don't text other guys, I know I fucked up, once, but just because I did one thing, doesn't mean you
        can be always mean to me. Please understand that. I don't want to make it look like it's your fault and you're
        the bad one, you're not, but your words hurt me too, okay? I am very sensitive and when you call me names, it
        hurts me emotionally and sometimes makes me want to hurt myself too. Please don't hurt yourself, I know you want
        to try new things, but self-harm is really bad and who knows, what if you will be addicted? I want to be there
        for you and support you, just not in this field. I want to love you with my whole heart, my whole soul is
        connected to yours and I want this relationship to work out. So, let's work this out together! I love you so
        much, pookie
      <h3>𝔗𝔥𝔦𝔰 𝔩𝔞𝔰𝔱 𝔴𝔢𝔢𝔨</h3>
      <p>Oh, well, this week was awful, I know we are on a break, hopefully it's nothing bad right..right? I want to be
        with you for the rest of my life and I can't imagine my life without you. Just the thought of losing you is
        heartbreaking. Natka fucked a lot of things up, so did I and including you. It kinda makes me sad that she
        understood you better than I did, I think the moment you said that, something inside of me died (plus the things
        you said when you were mad), I know I am not the greates girlfriend, but I would never cheat on you. You might
        consider it micro cheating, because of my personality and how I interact with people, but I've never flirted
        with anyone or respond in a way where it looks like I'm single. Everyone knows about you, I talk about you all
        the time (that just reminded me how you talk about me to your friends..oof I always talk good about you, except
        to Naty, where I wanted to tell her how I realistilly view our relationship, other than that everyone from my
        friends think of you really well, but for you, I am mentally sick. whatever). At first I thought you didn't want
        me to have guy friends, but now I understand you more, that the way I approah people or talk to them is not what
        you like. I've changed and I accept my mistakes and the punishment that comes wth it. I can't change the past,
        but I can change the present. I hope you will also change for me and be less cruel with your words, I think it's
        mutual? You will always think about it and I will always think about what you said to me. I know you don't mean
        it, usually you're exhausted, drunk or tired. I get that, but my heart is very sensitive and words like 'jseš
        zbytečná, neumíš pořádně uklízet, uvaříš jen jedno jídlo, zasraná kurva, jseš horší než tizina' really..
        affected me, you really know how to hit my weak spots, don't you... Maybe that's why
        I want to cut myself constantly, because it's constantly in my mind. I can't erase it. I believe both of us will
        recover and build the trust back. You have your reasons for your actions, so do I, so let's not be hyprocites.
      </p>
      <p>I love you too much to leave you. Other than that, I still look forward to the
        psychiatric program. I don't want to bring both of us down cause of my mental illness. But understand that my
        mentall illness cannot be cured, just stabilised for living, I suffer in silence sometimes, so you can be at
        peace. You have to keep in mind, I told you before we were
        dating, that I am mentally unstable and you know I had a community and such. You can't go in a relationship
        expecting the person to completely change. You don't date a fat woman and force or expect her to be instantly
        skinny, you can motivate her instead though. Anyway, I've prepared a terminology for you:
