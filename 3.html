        <h3>𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔭𝔱𝔢𝔯 I</h3>
        <p>When I heard about you, I knew I just wanted to be with you, for some reason you reminded me of myself. When
          we first met, the way you greeted me felt so nice, your hug was so addicting and although in the beginning I
          was shy, I still craved your hugs and cuddles. The second day when I woke up and realized what happened, I was
          quite embarrassed and a little nervous next to you, but soon I got comfortable enough to tell you about my
          problems. When we were in Berlin, I really enjoyed it, I wasn't with my family and you took care of
          everything. I still think about it now and then.</p>
        <h3>𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔭𝔱𝔢𝔯 II</h3>
        <p>After Berlin we both knew what happened, it was unfortunate, but we figured it out. I was so scared I would
          lose you (to be honest, in the moment I wouldn't mind so much, but if I did lose you, I would never know how
          of a good
          person you are.). It makes me flattered that you trust me even after that. What are the chances that a
          relationship would start this way? Low, very low.</p>
        <h3>𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔭𝔱𝔢𝔯 III</h3>
        <p>When we started dating, I felt relieved and happy that I could finally love someone effortlessly and pretty
          much all the time, you didn't mind my clinginess, which is.. new? I never had a chance to show someone how
          much I love them, usually, they just ignore it or take it for granted. Dating you is like starting a new
          chapter, a new chance at life.</p>
        <h3>𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔭𝔱𝔢𝔯 IV</h3>
        <p>Oh, the time when I was at the mental hospital, was terrible, all I wanted to do was cry. It felt like they
          gave me a lobotomy, I couldn't sleep, talk or eat. All I was thinking about was getting out and spending time
          with you. I am lucky they let me out sooner than it was supposed to be. Sneaking out to sleep at your place
          and do things behind my family's back was risky, but so thrilling. I love it, but I love it more that we live
          together now.</p>
        <h3>𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔭𝔱𝔢𝔯 V</h3>
        <p>So.. now we live together. It's fantastic, but it's just a bit stressful since we argue a lot, but that's
          what couples do. Communicate and communicate till it's fixed, right? Sometimes I miss my family, but I enjoy
          your company way more than at home. I mean what should I miss? The constant abuse? The screaming and yelling?
          Repetitive emotional neglect? I mean, after all, it's still my family, isn't it? I like my family and you're
          also my family, I hope we can marry each other one day and enjoy our lives to the fullest. I love you so much.
        </p>
        <h3>𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔭𝔱𝔢𝔯 VI</h3>
        <p>Now we are on a break, the week was tough. But luckily we made it, is the arguing phase over? I can't tell yet, who knows what will we have in the future, but right now I want to focus on the presence. I can't look at the future without fixing my problems right now, right? I get a little sad when I think about what happened or what you said, but it will eventually go away. We just have to work together!</p>
        <h3>𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔭𝔱𝔢𝔯 VII</h3>
        <p>I see, even though we talked it out you're still mean to me without a reason, or is your reason the same, the fact you can't forgive and forget? It's fine, I love y</p>
